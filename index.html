<p>My name is Nilantha Dambadeniy. I was born in countryside village called Dambadeniya in Sri Lanka. I have three siblings and I am the second oldest one in the family. My father is a small business man and my mother is a housewife.  I did my primary education at a school in my hometown and I moved to a city for my secondary and collage studies. I met my life partner when I was an undergrad and we got marred after completing our bachelor&rsquo;s degrees.</p>
<p>Later, we moved to Ohio, United States for my wife&rsquo;s higher education. After coming to the United States, I decided to complete my higher education as well. First I did an Associate degree in Computer Network Software at Cuyahoga Community College at Cleveland, and I worked as a Siebel developer for BBVA compass bank in Alabama. Last year, we moved to Maryville, Missouri and I decided to start my graduate studies at Northwest Missouri State University. Today, I am persevering my graduate studies in Applied Computer Science for my master&rsquo;s degree in ACS. </p>
<p>I was pond of computers since I was a teenage boy, and I always wanted to be a software developer who makes all those fancy and complicated magical programs. First, I started learning about lot of software packages such as MS Office, Photoshop, CorelDraw, Dream Viewer and adobe flash, then I got a chance to work with few stand along programs while I was working at few stores and companies. Once I got selected for my undergraduate program at University of Preradeniya, I was able to select computer programming as my major. I learned little bit of everything on computers and programming such as software application packages, java, C, C++, DBMS, Data structures, Data modeling and so on. After completing my undergrad, I worked as a Data analysis at UNOPS. After I moved to the United States and after completed my associate degree at Tri-C, I worked as a developer at BBVA. </p>
<p>My future plan after completing my master&rsquo;s is, gather little more experience on software developing and form a small software developing company. </p>
